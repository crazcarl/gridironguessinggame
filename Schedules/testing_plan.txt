We'll take turns being the "admin" per week.

I went ahead and made the user Rutarded an Admin. It will give you access to the admin menu in the top right corner.

All you'll need to do for the schedule is copy and paste the schedule into the schedule box on the bottom and click the button on the bottom.

The other piece is loading the winner picks. This entails logging in with the winner user and making picks. Make sure you get them right, because I haven't handled for that user making multiple picks, I don't think.

username: winner
password: asdf

Making the picks with winner should trigger the standing table to be populated. I'm doing caching in the background to limit the number of times the db is accessed. I think there was a problem with this where it wouldn't update the cache correctly. So once you submit the picks click the winner page and see if they are updated.
